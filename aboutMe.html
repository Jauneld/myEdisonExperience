                    <p>There are images of planes in the college's upper and lower left corners because they represent a potential career path I would like to take and an outlook on life I would like to adopt this year. 
                        I am applying to colleges that are on this career path.  I want to either become a pilot or something that will grant me the possibility to be free to make any choice I want. In addition, the aircrafts 
                        signify a mindset that I strive for—the sky's the limit and if I put my mind to anything, I can go anywhere. Then there is a yacht on the vision board because I want to go sailing this year or travel on a ship. 
                        The picture that portrays a balloon floating from a little girl in the upper right corner represents my future self. In the future, I want to leave my comfort zone and go out into the world. The balloon signified 
                        my childhood which I soon will have to let go and embrace adulthood. The quote, “Self Care Isn’t Selfish,” is a motto for me and shows me that I can take time for myself and am not selfish
                        for putting my needs above all else. At the bottom, there are pictures of family and friends who I would like to spend most of my time with. I might be dorming for college so these are the last moments I can savor 
                        with them. Family and friends are important because they keep me grounded and make me who I am today. The cross in the center represents my religion. It is an important part of me because it develops my morals and guides
                        me to be the best person I can be. I want to reconnect with my faith  because I believe that I have strayed and I want to get on track. Lastly, the word life is important because I love life, and life is filled with many 
                        wonders and opportunities. </p>
