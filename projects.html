              <p class="lead">You have decided to design a fashion chatbot that helps people pick out their fashion preferences. Your bot can gauge what types of clothes and accessories the user might like. Your chatbot should ask the user the following (minimum requirements for the grader) and then give answers depending on the answers the user inputs:
                <br>
                at least 6 questions
                at least 3 if-elif-else statements
                the use of the random module and randomly generated numbers
                <br>
                Based on these criteria, some responses will be based on what the user types and some will be based on random numbers.

The difficulty was to keep track of the number of variables and what the chatbot will say when the user input yes, no, or any other answer. After completing it, it was fun to talk to the Chatbot. To edit the code, I would have added more questions to talk to the user.</p>

                You must use string operations (concatenation or splicing) to create your own beat, using the EarSketch function makeBeat().
                You must use for loops to add repetition to your ringtone.
                You must use at least one user-defined (custom) function to create musical sections for your ringtone.
                Your ringtone should be a minimum of 60 seconds and a maximum of 90 seconds
                Your ringtone should include a sound clip found in the EarSketch sound library.

              <p class="lead">I had a blast while working on this project. I wanted to make a funky and unique beat that would stand out when played. I wanted the user to enjoy and dance to their ringtone rather than be annoyed at how it sounds. The hardest part of the project was to find beats that blend well together and conveys my theme well. It was a tough task but I believe that I completed it well. The part I enjoyed the most was hearing the product after every choice I made. I felt proud that I could make a song so well put together. I would like to make a different song that had more planning and thought put into the process of making the song.</p>

                <pre><code>Reflection Questions
1. Describe the theme of your project. What is it about? 
What story does it tell?
                                                 
  The project was to be about a girl walking her dog in a 
  forest. I wanted the theme to be peaceful and relatable.


2. How is the theme that you chose above reflected in 
the graphics you created?
                                                 
  I used various shapes to create the background and the 
  characters. It made the peaceful scene that I wanted.


3. Describe a problem, challenge, or error you had while 
writing the code for your assignment and how you solved it.
                                                 
  I had an issue with how to use loops to make the animation 
  run. The way I solved the issue was to do some research on 
  how to use loops in the animation. I also asked my 
  classmates how they used the loops in their works. It 
  helped to hear people explain how they got the animation 
  to work. Also, I had difficulty making my initial idea into 
  an animation so I changed into something simpler.


4.Iteration is the process of trying out solutions, then 
changing them over and over until a project is complete. 
How did you use iteration while creating your program?
                  
  I used iteration to have the things I designed to move.


5.If you had more time to work on this assignment, what would 
you like to add to your project?
                                                 
I would have added more details in the animation and made a 
short film.

To edit the code, I would make the dots smaller so they appear as a pencil stroke and change the cursor's icon to a pencil. I would also make it possible for the user to have a access to the option to erase the entire page, or they control where to erase. Overall, I am proud of my work. </p>
